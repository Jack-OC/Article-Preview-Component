### What I learned
From this challenge I gained more experience in creating webpages based on pre-made designs and using basic Javascript. This challenge was a simple article component that when the share button is clicked, a tooltip with links to social media pages pops up. To place the tooltip element where it is in the given designs I used the CSS position property. This was initially difficult, but after researching the property and testing it, I was more confident with position.
